\enumb
\item How many different paths are there from $a$ to $b$?
\item How many different walks are there from $a$ to $b$?
\enume
\item Prove that $K_n$ is connected.
\item Suppose $G$ is a connected graph in which each vertex has even degree. Then, $G$ has no cut edges.
\item List all the trees
\enumb
\item with vertex set $\{1,2,3\}$
\item with vertex set $\{1,2,3,4\}$
\enume
\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)] Let $T$ be a tree with $n\geq 1$ vertices. Prove that $T$ has $n-1$ edges.


\item[b)] Prove the converse, i.e. that if $G$ is a connected graph that has exactly $n-1$ edges then $G$ must be a tree.


\end{enumerate}
\item Let $T$ be a tree. Prove that the average degree of a vertex in $T$ is less than $2$.
