\bl[Proposition]{Let $P$ be a path in a graph $G$. Then $P$ does not traverse any edge of $G$ more than once.}
Suppose FTSC that some path $P$ in a graph $G$ traverses the edge $e=uv$ more than once. Then
\begin{align*}
P&=\dots\sim u\sim v\sim\dots\sim u\sim v\sim\dots\qquad\textrm{or}\\
P&=\dots\sim u\sim v\sim\dots\sim v\sim u\sim\dots

Either case, we repeated $u$ and thus $P$ is not a path. $\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$.\qed\vspace{0.3cm}\pause

We have the following alternative definition:
\bl[Definition]{ A \textbf{path} is a graph with vertex set $V=\{v_1,v_2,\dots, v_n\}$ and edge set
\[
E=\{v_iv_{i+1}: 1\leq i<n\}
\]

\itemb
\item \underline{Reflexive}:

If $v$ is a vertex, then the path $(v)$ is a $(v,v)$-path and so $v$ is connected to $v$.

\item \underline{Symmetric}:

Suppose, in a graph $G$, vertex $u$ is connected to vertex $v$. This means there is a $(u,v)$-path $P$ in $G$. Then it's reversal $P^{-1}$ is a $(v,u)$ path, and so $v$ is connected to $u$.
\item \underline{Transitive}:

Suppose $x$ is connected to $y$, which is connected to $z$. This means that there is a $(x,y)$ path $P$ and a $(y,z)$ path $Q$ in $G$. We want to show that there is also an $(x,z)$-path. The obvious candidate is the concatenation $P+Q$.

~~~~Suppose FTSC, that $P$ is not an $(x,y)$-path. Then there must be a repeated vertex $u$ on the path:
\[
P=x\sim\dots ? \sim u\textcolor{blue}{\sim\dots\sim u}\sim??\sim\dots\sim y.

\bl[Definition]{Let $G$ be a graph. A vertex $v\in V(G)$ is a \textbf{cut vertex} of $G$ provided $G-v$ has more components than $G$. Similarly, an edge $e\in E(G)$ is called a \textbf{cut edge} of $G$ provided $G-e$ has more components than $G$.}
In the special case when $G$ is connected:
\itemb
\item A cut vertex $v$ is such that $G-v$ is disconnected.
\item An edge $e$ is a cut edge if $G-e$ is disconnected.
\iteme
However the cutting does not result in big disconnectedness.

\begin{frame}
\bl[Theorem]{Let $G$ be a connected graph and suppose $e\in E(G)$ is a cut edge of $G$. Then $G-e$ has exactly two components.} 
~~~~By the definition of a cutting edge, $G-e$ has at least two components. We will show that it has exactly two. 

~~~~FTSC assume that it is not so and let $a,b,c$ be three vertices of $G-e$, all in different components. This means that there is no path connecting any two of them.

~~~~Let $P$ be an $(a,b)$-path in $G$. Since this does not survive for $G-e$, $P$ must traverse $e$. Suppose that $e=xy$ and
\[
P=a\sim\dots\sim x\sim y\sim\dots\sim b.
\]
Similarly, since $G$ is connected, there is a $(c,a)$-path $Q$ from $c$ to $a$ that must use the edge $e=xy$.

\itemb
\item If $x$ appears first, then the $(c,x)$ portion of $Q$ concatenated to the $(x,a)$-portion of $P^{-1}$ produces a $(c,a)$ walk in $G-e$. Therefore we also have a $(c,a)$ path in $G-e$, which contradicts the assumption. $\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$.

~~~~ The term can also refer to the (sub)graph consisting of the vertices and edges of such a walk. In other words, a cycle is a graph of the form $G=(V,E)$ where 
\[
V=\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\},\qquad E=\{v_1v_2,v_2v_3,\dots,v_{n-1}v_n,v_nv_1\}.

\bl[Theorem]{Let $T$ be a tree. For any two vertices $a$ and $b$ in $V(T)$, there is a unique $(a,b)$ path. Conversely, any graph $G$ with this property must be  a tree.}
($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $T$ is a tree and let $a,b\in V(T)$. We need to prove that there is a unique $(a,b)$-path in $T$.

~~~~ Since $T$ is connected, there is at least one $(a,b)$ path. FTSC assume that there were two (or more) different $(a,b)$-paths $P$ or $Q$ in $T$; Let $x$ be the first place where they differ, i.e.
\[
P: a\sim\dots\sim x\sim\textcolor{blue}{y}\sim\dots\sim b,\qquad Q: a\sim \dots\sim x\sim\textcolor{blue}{z}\sim\dots\sim b
\]
This also means that the edge $xy$ cannot be in $Q$. Consider the graph $T-xy$.

\bl[Theorem]{Let $T$ be a tree. For any two vertices $a$ and $b$ in $V(T)$, there is a unique $(a,b)$ path. Conversely, any graph with this property must be  a tree.}
Consider the graph $T-xy$.
\itemb
\item Consider the following $(x,y)$-walk in $T$. Start at $x$, follow $P^{-1}$ from $x$ to $a$, then follow $Q$ from $a$ to $b$ and then follow $P^{-1}$ from $b$ to $y$. This does not traverse $xy$ and therefore there is a walk and thus a path from $x$ to $y$ in $T-xy$ Call it $R$.
\item If we now concatenate $R$ and $xy$, we get a cycle in a tree which is impossible. $\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$
\iteme
($\Leftarrow$) FTSC assume that $G$ has a cycle. Then take two points $x$, $y$ on the cycle. Then clearly we have at least two ways to go from $x$ to $y$. (Two direction along the cycle.)$\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$.\qed

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Leafs}
\bl[Definition]{A \textbf{leaf} of a graph is a vertex of degree one.}
\bl[Theorem]{Every tree with at least two vertices has at least two leafs.}
Let $T$ be a tree with at least two vertices and let $P$ be a longest path in $T$. Then $P$ has two or more vertices, say
\[
P=v_0\sim v_1\sim\dots\sim v_l,\qquad l\geq 1.
\]
We claim that $v_0$ and $v_l$ must be leaves. If this was not so, then $v_0$ would have another neighbor $x$ that cannot be on $P$ because that would give a cylce. But then appending $x$ to the beginning of $P$ would give a longer path contradicting the maximality of $P$. Similar argument proves that $v_l$ is a leaf.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Leafs}
\bl[Proposition]{Let $T$ be a tree and let $v$ be a leaf of $T$. Then $T-v$ is a tree.}
~~~~Clearly, $T-v$ cannot contain a cylce, because then the same cycle would be there in $T$ as well, which is impossible as $T$ is a tree.

~~~~To show that $T-v$ is connected, let $a,b\in V(T-v)$. Since $T$ is connected, there is an $(a,b)$ path $P$ in $T$. FTSC assume that
\[
P=a\sim\dots\sim v\sim\dots\sim b
\]
Since $v$ is not any of the endpoints, this would mean that $d(v)=2$, which is not the case as $v$ is a leaf. $\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$.  This means that $v$ cannot be on the path $P$ and therefore $P$ is an $(a,b)$-path in $T-v$ as well.

~~~~Since the choice of $a,b$ were arbitrary, $T-v$ is connected. This finishes the proof.\qed

\begin{frame}{Further characterization of trees}
\bl[Theorem]{Let $G$ be a connected graph. Then $G$ is a tree if and only if every edge is a cutting edge.}
In this sense, trees are minimally connected graphs. For the proof, see the textbook.

\begin{frame}[t]{Spanning subgraphs}
\bl[Definition]{Let $G$ be a graph. A \textbf{spanning tree} of $G$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$ that is a tree.}
\bl[Theorem]{A graph has a spanning tree if and only if it is connected.}
\only<1>{($\Rightarrow$) Suppose $G$ has a spanning tree $T$. Let $u,v\in V(G)$. Since $T$ is spanning, we have $V(T)=V(G)$, and so $u,v\in V(T)$. Since $T$ is connected, there is a $(u,v)$-path $P$ in $T$. Since $T$ is a subgraph, $P$ is also a $(u,v)$-path of $G$.}

\only<2>{($\Leftarrow$) Suppose $G$ is connected. Let $T$ be a spanning connected subgraph of $G$ with the least number of edges. We claim that $T$ is a tree.

~~~~By construction, $T$ is connected. We show that every edge of $T$ is a cut edge. Otherwise, if $E(T)$ were not a cut edge of $T$, then $T-e$ would be a smaller spanning connected subgraph of $G$. $\Rightarrow\Leftarrow$.\qed}
