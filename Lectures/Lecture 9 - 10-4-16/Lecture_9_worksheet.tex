\maketitle

In all of the above problems explain your answer in full English sentences.

\enumb
\item Evaluate $\multiset{3}{2}$ and $\multiset{2}{3}$ by explicitely listing all possible multisets of the appropriate size.
\item Evaluate the following special values
\enumb
\item \multiset{0}{n}
\item \multiset{n}{0}
\item \multiset{0}{0}
\enume

\item What multiset is encoded by the stars-and-bars notation $*|||***$ ? What set are the elements taken form?


\item There are four large groups of people, each with $1000$ members. Any two of these groups have $100$ members in common. Any three of these groups have $10$ members in common. There is $1$ person in all four groups. All together, how many people are in these groups?

\item The number of length-$6$ lists whose elements are chosen from the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ is $5^6$. How many of these use all of the elements in $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$?
\enume
